this is my cupcake recipe.
cupcakes are very tasty they are like mini cakes which you can eat on the go.
these cupcakes are very easy to make and require minimal ingridients.
these cupcakes are chocolate falvoured but you can swith out some ingridients to make the falvour to your liking. These cupcakes can be eaten cooled or if you are looking for something more like a lava cake you can take the cupcakes hot out of the oven and put some vanilla ice cream on them! these chocolate cupcakes are worth making and i'm sure you'll enjoy them.
